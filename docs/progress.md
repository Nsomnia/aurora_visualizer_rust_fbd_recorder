## Goal: Integrate ProjectM with egui

The primary challenge is rendering the ProjectM visualization, which uses its own OpenGL context, within an `egui` UI.

## Solution: `egui_glow`

The `egui_glow` crate provides a thread-safe `Painter` that can be used to render custom `glow` graphics in an `egui` application. This solves the thread-safety issues encountered when trying to use `glow::Context` directly.

## Status

- **`projectm_widget.rs`**:
    - Rewritten to use `egui_glow::Painter` and a `ProjectMVisualizer` struct.
- **`main.rs`**:
    - Updated to use the new `ProjectMVisualizer` and the `egui_glow::Painter`.
    - Implemented audio processing to drive the visualization.
- **`Cargo.toml`**:
    - Added the `egui_glow` crate.
- **Build**:
    - The project now builds and runs successfully.

## Next Steps

- Add more UI controls for selecting presets and configuring the visualization.
