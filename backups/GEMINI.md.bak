## Current Task

The user wants to get the ProjectM visualization working within an `egui` window.
The last attempt to modify `projectm_widget.rs` failed due to API limits and some incorrect code.

## Plan

1.  **Re-evaluate `projectm_widget.rs`**: The previous edit was a good start, but had errors. I need to re-read the file and the surrounding context.
2.  **Create Shader Files**: The previous edit referenced `shader.vert` and `shader.frag`, but they don't exist. I need to create them in `music_visualizer/src/`.
3.  **Fix `projectm_widget.rs`**:
    - Correctly initialize the FBO and texture in `ProjectMWidget::new`. The texture needs to be allocated with a size.
    - Correctly compile and link the shader program. I need to check for compilation errors.
    - In the `PaintCallback`, ensure the viewport is set correctly before rendering ProjectM.
    - Implement the drawing of the textured quad. This will involve setting up a vertex buffer.
4.  **Fix `main.rs`**: The `ProjectMWidget::new` signature has changed, so I'll need to update the call in `main.rs`.
5.  **Build and Verify**: Run `cargo build` to check for errors.
