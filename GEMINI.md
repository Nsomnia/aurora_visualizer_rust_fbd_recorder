# Project: Aurora Visualizer RS

This file tracks the high-level status and immediate task for the Gemini agent.

Detailed documentation is maintained in the `/docs` directory.

## Current Task

**Priority 1: Implement Core Audio Playback**

The primary goal is to get audio file playback working correctly so that the ProjectM visualizer reacts to the audio.

**Status:**
- The current implementation using the `cpal` audio library is failing to compile due to trait bound errors in `music_visualizer/src/playback.rs`.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Fix the compilation errors in `music_visualizer/src/playback.rs`.
2.  Verify that audio files can be loaded and played.
3.  Confirm that the ProjectM visualizer is receiving the audio data and reacting to it.
